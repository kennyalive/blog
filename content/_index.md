The limited amount of content here is about computer programming.

My name is Artem Kharytoniuk. I run Seminumerical Sweden AB, a small company focusing on producing good software. The areas of specialization are graphics, ray tracing, related math foundation, software that does not run slow on amazing modern hardware, low-level programming, search for solutions that simplify the systems and make them more understandable. Currently, I'm doing some work for the Vulkan graphics API ecosystem.
