The limited amount of content here is about computer programming.

My name is Artem Kharytoniuk.
I run Seminumerical Sweden AB. It's a small company that focuses on producing good software.

The areas of specialization are graphics, ray tracing, maths, software that does not run slow on modern hardware, lower-level programming.

These days I spend most of my time on the Vulkan Validation Layers project, trying to fix synchronization issues.
