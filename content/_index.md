Artem Kharytoniuk welcomes you to his web page.

The limited amount of content here is about computer programming.

I run Seminumerical Sweden AB, a small company focusing on producing good software. The areas of specialization are graphics, ray tracing, related math foundation, software that does not run slow on amazing modern hardware (as of 2023, hardware is still great), low-level programming, and search for solutions that simplify the systems and make them more understandable. Currently, I'm doing some work for the Vulkan graphics API ecosystem.
