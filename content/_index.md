Hello visitor...

My name is Artem Kharytoniuk and this is my public online space. This is an introductory section but I'm shy to write a lot about myself, so I'll write about this introductory section instead. I put it under the list of my posts because they are the reason why this site exists and introduction section is a secondary goal. When I write more posts the list will grow and it will push this introduction below the window edge. I'm not sure if my web skills are good enough to fix that. I hope I'll be famous enough by that time, so introduction won't be necessary, otherwise I'll fix HTML and CSS, I promise.

Thank you for visiting my site, visitor. Take care and don't get lost in the webs.
